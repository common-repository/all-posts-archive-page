A plugin to create an "all posts since this site started by month" page. Built for sites using the Genesis Framework.

== Description ==
This plugin creates a new WordPress page template called "Binge Reading Archive by Month." Using this page template will create a listing of all posts by month since the site's creation in chronological order. It is useful for new readers who want to catch up on the entire history of the blog. Like Netflix binge watching or podcast binge listening, but for your blog!
